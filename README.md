# Animal Directory CRUD API

A basic CRUD application to manage an animal directory using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. This API allows you to perform create, read, update, and delete operations on animal records.

## Features

- **GET**: Retrieve a list of all animals
- **POST**: Add a new animal to the directory
- **PUT**: Update an existing animal
- **DELETE**: Remove an animal from the directory

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- MongoDB (local or Atlas cluster)
- Postman or any other API client for testing

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_folder>

### Instructions for Use

1. Replace `<repository_url>` and `<repository_folder>` with your actual repository URL and folder name.
2. Update the `MONGODB_URI` value with your MongoDB connection string.
3. Save the file as `README.md` in the root directory of your project.

This single file `README.md` should provide a clear overview and guide for setting up and using your CRUD API application. If you have any more questions or need further adjustments, just let me know!
